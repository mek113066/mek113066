- 👋 Hi, I’m mek113066@gmail.com
- 👀 I’m interested in Engineering, Programming (COMM), Music, Art and humour.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git Hub and Python.  I'm a 'C' and sometimes a Pascal man myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Volumio.  I've had a hell of a fight installing and running a stable release. Others report a perfectly sound bit of kit. It's obviously me but what am I doing wrong?  I have both a Pi 3 & 4 and want very much to play music on them. 
- 📫 How to reach me, email mek113066@gmail.com and it will find me in the land down-under.
